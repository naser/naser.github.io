My research group, Software Testing and Analytics Research, consists of several undergrads, masters and PhD students. We are supported by
generous funding from Mitacs, NSERC and several other funding agencies. Our work is closely intertwined with industry, and we collaborate 
with companies like Ciena to produce cutting edge research outputs.

We are always looking for brilliant and motivated students to work with us. If you think you are one of them, head over to the
