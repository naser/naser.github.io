My research group, Automated Software Testing & Analysis Research, consists of several undergrads, and masters students. We are supported by
generous funding from Mitacs, NSERC and several other funding agencies. Our work is closely intertwined with the industry, and we collaborate 
with companies like Ciena to produce cutting edge research outputs.

We are always looking for brilliant and motivated students to work with us. Currently, I am looking for undergrad and graduate students 
(masters and PhD) to work with. If you think you are one of them, head over to the "[Contact me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tabs/contact)" page and 
reach out to us.
