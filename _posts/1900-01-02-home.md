I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science, Brock University. My research work is mainly on automated software analysis and performance 
evaluation of complex software systems in the era of cloud, distributed systems and Internet of Things.

* Courses that I am teaching - [Teaching]({{ site.baseurl }}/tabs/teaching)

### Research
My research interest consists of-

* Software Engineering,
* Software Analysis,
* Software Debugging,
* Performance Evaluation,
* Energy Efficiency 

I am particularly interested in operating system level methods, e.g., execution tracing and profiling, to support the aformentioned topics in the context of IoT, cloud and distributed systems. Currently, I am looking for masters and PhD students, visiting researchers, and postdocs to work with. If your research interests aligns with mine, head over to the "[Contact me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tabs/contact)" page and reach out.
