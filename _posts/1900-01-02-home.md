### Research
My research interest consists of-

* Software Engineering,
* Software Analysis,
* Software Debugging,
* Performance Evaluation,
* Energy Efficiency 

I am particularly interested in operating system level methods, e.g., execution tracing and profiling, to support the aformentioned topics in the context of IoT, cloud and distributed systems. Currently, I am looking for masters and PhD students, visiting researchers, and postdocs to work with.
